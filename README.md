## Speakers

- We need speakers - on anything that you think will be of interest to other members. Maybe you'd like to try out something you're proposing for the [RSE Conference](http://www.rse.ac.uk/conf2016)? We're anticipating short talks of about 10 mins, depending on how many speakers we get.

## Discussion

- What points would you like to see covered in a discussion of future Network activities?
- How should the discussion be structured?
